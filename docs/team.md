The Nimbus client suite is built and maintained by a passionate and driven team of 10 technologists from around the world.

Development work is divided into subgroups, each focusing on one of the three client implementations. Skillsets and requirements often overlap, meaning that some members take on responsibilities across the subgroups. Additionally, several team members are core contributors to Nim, the programming language in which Nimbus clients are written.

### Nimbus consensus

The team maintaining the in-production Nimbus consensus client consists of a development lead, two supporting developers, a research officer and a senior data scientist. Combined, they draw on decades of experience both within the crypto and web3 sector, and at more traditional tech startups.

### Nimbus execution

Building the Nimbus execution client is a team consisting of a development lead, supporting developer, research engineer and software engineer. Like the consensus subgroup, the Nimbus execution client team has a rich background in software development both within web3 and beyond it.

### Nimbus Portal

Currently, the light client, Nimbus Portal, has one full-time developer with a background in software engineering and consultancy at various tech startups.

Nimbus is looking to expand the above structure and currently has multiple openings for core contributors. As an open-source public goods project Nimbus also welcomes community contributions.
